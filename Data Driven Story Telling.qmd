## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, we will mainly apply the principles we learned from Jane Miller's book in practice. You will review multiple examples of data description and presentation intext, table/number, and charts/figures. Please read the instructions for each part and complete your challenges.

**For all the screenshots, images, or tables mentioned in the questions, please see the Challenge_6_Fall23.html file. You don't need to include any of these items in your rendered challenge file.**

## Part 1. Simple Applications {#part-1.-the-ufo-sightings-data-50}

1.  **Recall Jane Miller's Ws mentioned in Chapter 2. One of the W's (Who, What, When, and Where, Why) is missing from each of the following table descriptions. Rewrite each sentence to include that information.**

    ![](Ch1_table2b.png)

    a.  "Germany did the best at the 2002 Winter Olympics, with 35 medals, compared to 34 for the United States, 24 for Norway, and 17 for Canada."
    
    Ans: Germany excelled at the 2002 Winter Olympics, securing 35 medals. This notable achievement occurred in Salt Lake City, USA, during the winter of 2002. Germany's success could be attributed to various factors, such as their athletes' exceptional skills, training programs, and strategic approaches. In comparison, the United States won 34 medals, Norway earned 24, and Canada received 17.

    b.  "Gold, silver, and bronze medals each accounted for about one-third of the medal total."
    
    Ans: At the 2002 Winter Olympics, the United States secured a total of 34 medals. Among these, they achieved 10 gold, 13 silver, and 11 bronze medals. Each of these significant medal counts made up approximately one-third of their total medals.

    c.  "At the 2002 Winter Olympics, the United States won more medals than all other countries, followed by Canada, Germany, and Norway."
    
    Ans: At the 2002 Winter Olympics, the United States achieved an impressive total of 34 medals. This medal count surpassed that of Norway and Canada, who secured 24 and 17 medals, respectively. Only Germany outperformed the United States by winning a total of 35 medals. The Winter Olympics were held in Salt Lake City, USA.

2.  **For each of the following situations, specify whether you would use prose of text, a table of numbers, or a particular type of chart/figure. Explain why you chose this way to present the data.**

    a.  Statistics on five types of air pollutants in the 10 largest US cities for a government report
    
    Ans: For statistics on five types of air pollutants in the 10 largest U.S. cities, I would recommend using a table of numbers. This format allows for a clear and concise presentation of data, making it easy to compare pollutant levels across different cities. Each row in the table can represent a city, and columns can represent the various types of pollutants, providing a structured and organized way to present the information. Additionally, tables are suitable for government reports as they offer a straightforward format that is easy for policymakers and stakeholders to interpret.
    
    b.  Trends in the value of three stock market indices over one year for a web page
    
    Ans: For depicting trends in the value of three stock market indices over one year on a web page, a line chart or a time series plot would be a suitable choice. This type of chart effectively communicates the temporal evolution of stock values, allowing viewers to discern patterns and trends. Each index could be represented by a different colored line, providing a clear visual distinction. A line chart is particularly effective for conveying continuous data and is commonly used for time-series analysis. This format is user-friendly for web pages aswell.
    
    c.  Notification to other employees in your corporation of a change in shipping fees
    
    Ans: For a notification to other employees in your corporation regarding a change in shipping fees, a brief, clear, and informative prose of text in email would be a suitable choice. In the email, we can provide a concise explanation of the changes, specify the effective date, and include any relevant details or instructions. This format ensures that the information is quickly accessible to employees and allows them to refer back to the message as needed.
    
    d.  Distribution of voter preferences for grade-level composition of a new middle school (grades 5--8, grades 6--8, or grades 6--9) for a presentation at a local school board meeting
    
    Ans: For the distribution of voter preferences for grade-level composition of a new middle school (grades 5–8, grades 6–8, or grades 6–9) presented at a local school board meeting, a bar chart would be an effective visual representation. These type of chart allows us to illustrate the percentage or count of votes for each grade-level composition option in a clear and easy-to-understand format. This visual aid can help school board members and attendees quickly grasp the overall distribution of voter preferences and make informed decisions based on the presented data.
    
    e.  National estimates of the number of uninsured among part-time and full-time workers for an introductory section of an article analyzing effects of employment on insurance coverage in New York City
    
    Ans: For the introductory section of an article analyzing the effects of employment on insurance coverage in New York City, presenting national estimates of the number of uninsured among part-time and full-time workers, a combination of prose and a simple table of numbers would be effective. The prose can provide a concise overview of the key findings and trends, while a simple table can present detailed numerical information, such as the number of uninsured individuals in each category (part-time and full-time workers). This combination provides readers with a quick summary in the prose and allowing those interested in specific figures to refer to the table for more detailed information.

3.  **Read the sentences below. What additional information would someone need in order to answer the associated question?**

    a.  "Brand X costs twice as much as Brand Q. Can I afford Brand X?"
    
    Ans: To answer the question "Can I afford Brand X?" based on the information that "Brand X costs twice as much as Brand Q," we would need to know the specific cost or price of Brand Q. Without knowing the actual price of Brand Q, it's not possible to determine whether someone can afford Brand X, as the comparison is currently relative and lacks the absolute values needed for a financial assessment.
    
    b.  "My uncle is 6'6" tall? Will he fit in my new car?"
    
    Ans: To determine if my uncle will fit in my new car, I would need to know about the interior dimensions of the car, such as headroom, legroom, and overall space. The fact that my uncle is 6'6" tall gives an indication of his height, but without knowing the specific dimensions of the car's interior, it's not possible to assess whether he will comfortably fit inside.
    
    c.  "New Diet Limelite has 25% fewer calories than Diet Fizzjuice. How much faster will I lose weight on Diet Limelite?"
    
    Ans: To assess how much faster I might lose weight on Diet Limelite compared to Diet Fizzjuice, I would need additional information such as my current calorie intake including intake of Diet Fizzjuice, my daily calorie expenditure, and overall diet and lifestyle. Knowing that Diet Limelite has 25% fewer calories than Diet Fizzjuice is a helpful factor, but weight loss is a complex process influenced by various factors.
    
    d.  "It has been above 25 degrees every day. We're really having a warm month, aren't we?"
    
    Ans: To assess whether the month is unusually warm, additional information would be needed, such as the average temperature for the same month in previous years or the typical temperature range for this particular location during this season. Knowing that it has been above 25 degrees every day provides information about the current temperature, but it doesn't offer a comparative context to determine if the month is unusually warm.

4.  **Indicate whether each of the following sentences correctly reflects table 4B. If not, rewrite the sentence so that it is correct. Check both the correctness and completeness of these sentences.**

    Note: According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout), " In political science, voter turnout is the participation rate (often defined as those who cast a ballot) of a given election. This is typically the percentage of registered, eligible, or all voting-age people."

    ![](Ch5_table4b.png)

    a.  Between 1964 and 1996, there was a steady decline in voter participation.
    
    Ans: This statement inaccurately represented the table data. Voter participation experienced fluctuations over the years rather than a consistent decline. There was a significant drop of approximately 5% from 1968 to 1972, followed by a steady decline. However, in 1984, there was an unexpected increase of 1%, which was followed by a 3% decrease in 1988. Another notable increase occurred in 1992, rising by 5%, before ultimately declining by 7% until 1996.
    
    b.  Voter turnout was better in 1996 (63.4%) than in 1964 (61.9%).
    
    Ans: The statement is incorrect as it compares the voter turnout rate of 1996 with the voter participation of 1964. In reality, the voter turnout rate in 1996 was significantly lower at 63.4% compared to the higher voter turnout rate in 1964, which was around 95.8%.
    
    c.  The majority of all registered voters participated in the 1964 US presidential election.
    
    Ans: The statement is accurate but can be expressed more effectively. In 1964, there were a total of 73,716 registered voters, and out of this, 70,645 actively participated in the US presidential election, resulting in an impressive voter turnout of 95.8%.
    
    d.  The best year for voter turnout was 1992, with 104,600 people voting.
    
    Ans: The statement is inaccurate. The year with the highest voter turnout was 1964, boasting an impressive 95.8%. While 1992 had the largest voter count in that election, with 104,600 individuals casting their votes, the total number of registered voters was also higher at 133,821, resulting in a voter turnout percentage of 78.2%.
    
    e.  A higher percentage of the voting-age population was registered to vote in 1996 than in 1964.
    
    Ans: The statement is accurate but can be expressed more effectively. The voter registration percentage in 1996 was 74%, markedly surpassing the 64% recorded in 1964.

5.  **Identify terms that need to be defined or restated for a non-technical audience without much knowledge about the topic or statistical method. You don't need to explain these terms (you don't need to know any of the statistical methods mentioned).** **Just identify them.**

    a\. "According to the latest study based on the [VDem Dataset](https://v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/), the average Rule of Law score is statistically higher in democratic countries than non-democratic countries based on a t-test (p = 0.01)."
    
    Ans: Terms that may need clarification for a non-technical audience:
    1. VDem Dataset
    2. Rule of Law score
    3. t-test
    4. p-value

    b\. " According to the logistic regression results in the screenshot below, we can see a positive correlation between household income and the vote choice for G.W. Bush, with a positive coefficient (log-odd = 0.33). "
    
    Ans:Terms that may need clarification for a non-technical audience:
    1. Logistic regression
    2. Positive Correlation
    3. Positive Coefficient
    4. Log-odd value

    # Part 2. Practical Applications

6.  **Suppose you work as a data analyst in the music-producing industry. One day, you get a data report that studies the popularity of different genres of music. The following scatterplot is presented to you. There is no text description for either this table or the data.**

    ![](example_project.png)

    \(1\) What information can you describe or summarize based on the current graph?
    
    Ans: This chart illustrates the popularity of the Pop songs, with the Y-axis presumably representing a percentage of popularity. Although the X and Y axes lack proper labels, a majority of songs appear clustered between 2.5 and 5.0 on the X-axis, with a closer alignment to 2.5. These songs span on Y-axis from 25 to 100. Additionally, a few outliers are noticeable, falling within the range of 10.0 to 12.5.

    \(2\) Thinking of the principles we learned in the week of visualization customization and Jane Miller's principles, What additional information (Please describe at least three things (at least one thing that is NOT about graph customization, such as title, color, label, etc.) that you consider adding this table so that it can convey meaningful information.
    
    Ans: Enhancing this table for better comprehension involves several key improvements. First, a contextual description clarifying that the dots represent songs by different artists and are positioned based on popularity would provide essential context. Next, updating the x and y labels to reflect the actual metrics, such as the number of streams or replays and artist or song names, would improve clarity. Additionally, refining the x and y ticks to display meaningful values will enhance the interpretability of the data. Lastly, introducing visual distinctive attributes for high-performing artists and songs would make it easier for readers to identify and extract relevant information.

7.  **Two articles on scientific studies talk about the "risks." Please read the titles and quotes from these two articles and answer the following two questions.**

    ![](risks.png)

    \(1\) Given the information provided, in which case is there a greater "risk": the Pancreatic Cancer case or the Diabetes case?
    
    Ans: Considering the information presented, the elevated risk of pancreatic cancer, doubling at 200%, is indeed noteworthy. However, the context and details provided about type 2 diabetes indicate a more alarming situation, with the risk increasing by 18% over a decade. The nuanced information and timeframe associated with diabetes make it a more plausible and concerning health concern in this scenario.

    \(2\) Think of Jane Miller's principles. What additional information would you need to know to compare the "risk" in the two cases?
    
    Ans: To comprehensively compare the "risk" in the two cases, additional information is essential. Firstly, the duration of the study or the timeframe over which the risks were observed needs clarification. Understanding whether the observed risks are over a short-term or long-term period is crucial for a meaningful comparison. Additionally, details about the sample size and demographics of the populations studied for both pancreatic cancer and type 2 diabetes risks are necessary. Knowing the age groups, gender distribution, and other relevant factors will provide context and ensure a more accurate comparison. Lastly, insight into the specific methodologies and criteria used to define and measure "risk" in each case would contribute to a more nuanced evaluation.
